# Description

Blah blah, read this: [How to make a jailbreak without a filesystem remount as r/w](https://github.com/jakeajames/rootlessJB/blob/master/writeup.pdf)

- Powered by jelbrekLib

## Usage notes

- empty_list used by default. You can change that in sploit.c
- Cydia Impactor will BREAK the binaries and the only solution would be compressing files or saurik releasing an update. I will not bother with an ipa. If you really want it tell me at @Jakeashacks
- Binaries are located in: /var/containers/Bundle/iosbinpack64
- Launch daemons are located in /var/containers/Bundle/iosbinpack64/LaunchDaemons
- /var/containers/Bundle/tweaksupport contains a filesystem simulation where tweaks and stuff get installed
- Symlinks include: /var/LIB, /var/ulb, /var/bin, /var/sbin, /var/Apps

All executables must have at least these two entitlements:

    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>platform-application</key>
        <true/>
        <key>com.apple.private.security.container-required</key>
        <false/>
    </dict>
    </plist>


- Tweaks and stuff get installed in: /var/containers/Bundle/tweaksupport the same way you did with Electra betas.
- Tweaks must be patched using the patcher script provided. (Mac/Linux/iOS only) or manually with a hex editor
- Apps get installed in /var/Apps and later you need to run /var/containers/Bundle/iosbinpack64/usr/bin/uicache (other uicache binaries won't work)

# iOS 12
- No tweaks and code injection yet
- No amfid patch yet. Must run "inject /path/to/binary" before adding a new binary
- No jailbreakd yet
- No remount (heh?)

patcher usage:
./patcher /path/to/deb /path/to/output_folder
